 Key Features:
- Interactive UI built with Streamlit
- AI-powered backend using Gemini AI Flash 1.5 model
- Real-time predictions and responses
- Easy to set up and deploy

 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Frontend: Streamlit
- Backend: Gemini AI API (Flash 1.5 Model)
- Language: Python

 🚀 Getting Started

 Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need to have the following installed:
- Python 3

 Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
       github.com/omjadhav18/GeminiAPI_Project
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Set up your environment variables:
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Gemini API credentials:

   API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"


5. Run the project:

   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

6. Open the Streamlit app in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

 📁 Project Structure
